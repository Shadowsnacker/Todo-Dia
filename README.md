# 24hr Clock Planner

A full day's worth of visual planning via a 24hr clock!

## 🎯 Purpose
- I've always wanted a clock that could show an entire day! Well that's been done, but what about one that had an ability to allocate events like a planner, but one you can see?! This visual assist could guide others how to organize their days more fullfillingly as it did for me!
- Built to practice DOM maniputlation and JavaScript timing functions while creating something visually appealing and practical.

## 🛠️ Built with
- HTML/CSS/JavsScript
- Flask/jinja
- [Soon to be first deployed project!]

  ## 🌟 Features
  - The real local-time is marked along the outer edge of the clock with a little Sun/Moon emoji
  - Inside the space the user can click within any hour and allocate any number of hours towards an event
  - Color-coding each allocated area with a full spectrum color-wheel
  - Simple "View Stored Data" button that stores locally in temp internet files
  - Delete Button for easy refreshes
